<p>The application (Jaib) is a savings management application that facilitates users and helps them save
    money for their personal needs, as it supports both Arabic and English languages. You can find our app
    in most of the mobile app stores. If you are one of those people who spend and can't control the
    purchase of what you are looking for, be it a car, a house or paying a debt, our app can help you adjust
    your behavior patterns. Our application regularly transfers amounts when you get the salary, it takes a
    percentage of 10% or you can choose the percentage you want according to your salary, and then it
    keeps it until the amount is completed, so the task requires patience to get what you want. After that,
    the application will send notifications if the amount is completed.and the coolest feature is that the app
    is completely FREE!
